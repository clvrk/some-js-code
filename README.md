Hey, so, this is the folder where i store basic js stuff such as functions blah blah blah, so on.

Read it if you'd like, but i do recommend actually practicing this stuff rather than reading it.

Side Note: 

I learnt the Javascript basics written down here from Anson The Developers Javascript Basics Playlist on Youtube, if you've come across this repository hoping to learn Javascript for free then, watch His Playlist.
